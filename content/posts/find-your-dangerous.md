Why do we find spies attractive? Why do we find army officers attractive? Why do we find the rich and the famous attractive? Why do we find fast cars attractive?

They're dangerous. That's not the first thing that you think of when you think of when you think attractive people. But it is at the core of it. And that's the truth to being attractive. You've got to be dangerous.

Spies and army officers are easier to identify as dangerous, not rich and the famous right? Dangerous is not exactly actually being a danger to people. But being dangerous if fucked with. You don't fuck with an army officer because of the power they wield, both bureaucratically and physically. Same with a rich person who has plenty of resources at their disposal to make your life harder.

If you're feeling low, that's what you need to find. What are you capable of? If someone fucked with you, what are you really capable of doing? Are you strong? Charismatic? Rich? Young? Old? Smart? A blade of grass is dangerous in the right hands. The simplest of skills are dangerous in the right mind.

And that's what I think makes teenagers so confident. You think you're hot shit. You think you can get your teacher fired if you really wanted to. You think that you can get that girl if you really wanted to. You think that you can make your high school bully regret it if you really wanted to. As a teenager you believed you were capable of a lot (maybe a stretch more than you were really capable of).

It's hard growing up because you realise how small of a world you really live in. And how scary it is. You're worried about a medical bill. You're worried about your boss not liking you. You're worried about the future.

Now obviously this is not the case for everyone, there are people that had a terrible high school experience and maybe weren't confident back then. In that case, my article probably can't help you but if you were felt invincible (like I did back in high school). Find that and recreate that.

It's why I love fast cars and racing. Every time I'm driving a car (real life or game), I fucking love the feeling of looking at the speedometer and knowing that in the wrong hands this could be a death trap. There's a certain power in taming danger. It's why people bought the widow maker Porsches and people still buy motorcycles.

Last week, I rented a motorcycle and it's been so many years since I'd ridden once but once I got the hang of it, I didn't shy away from giving it the throttle. Every time I heard the thrum of the engine and see the speedometer climb, I loved that feeling of danger.

Recreate this feeling of danger and power. You'll be confident. I know I'm gonna. Signing off.
